## Philipp Schreiber, Cologne, Germany, Europe, Earth  
Seasoned (14 years industry, 42 years age) software developer with strong product development and lead skills. Background in ecommerce, b2b and b2c service implementation and operation. Broad stack of technology. Pragmatic approach. Thorough experience in hands-on web-development. Mostly CRUD applications of various sorts and sizes. Meddling in product management a lot, mostly advisory, sometimes annoyingly so. 
Also thorough experience in keeping shit from fellow devs, getting them appreciation and giving them space to tackle challenges, gather new experiences, making the most of their abilities (otherwise known as management or leadership). Totally comfortable not to be the smartest or most knowledgable in any given room of devs, quite on the contrary.   
Since 2015 my priority #1 is my daughter.

## Education:

### Governmental Teacher Trainee
__Konrad-Adenauer-Gymnasium__  
__Feb 2007-June 2007__  
__Langenfeld, Germany__   

Teaching English and German in the German university-qualifying highschool track (Gymnasium). 
The logical step after graduating from University with the "1. Staatsexamen für die Lehrämter Sekundarstufe II und I". High school teaching just wasn't for me. So I pivoted as early as possible.

__Universität zu Köln__  
__2000-2006__  
__Köln, Germany__   

Full academic degree in German and English and educational sciences as minor. Equivalent to Master of Education. Governmental teaching track, which results in a state exam. So, yes, my completed formal education is in the humanities.

I did take a few CS courses at Feruniversität Hagen from 2013 to 2015 for a Master in applied cs, but did not continue after the birth of my daughter.
